// Example 1:

// Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
// Initially, X = 0.
// --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
// X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
// X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
// Example 2:

// Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
// Initially, X = 0.
// ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
// ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
// X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
// Example 3:

// Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
// Initially, X = 0.
// X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
// ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
// --X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
// X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
